      <h1>How Much is a Trillion?</h1>

      <p>
        A trillion is one million million (or one thousand billion) and has twelve zeroes:
        <strong> 1,000,000,000,000</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you owned a trillion dollars and spent <strong>$1,000,000</strong> each day, it would
        take you just under <strong>2,740 years</strong> to spend it all.
      </p>

      <h2>It's all about the money...</h2>
      <p>
        On 2 August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S company to reach a market cap
        of <strong>$1 trillion</strong>. Two years later its value had doubled to over{" "}
        <strong>$2 trillion</strong>, and less than 18 months after that it broke through the{" "}
        <strong>$3 trillion</strong> mark for the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other tech behemoths are also in the eye-watering market cap club: Microsoft is worth just
        over <strong>$3 trillion</strong>, Alphabet (Google) <strong>$2 trillion</strong> and Amazon{" "}
        <strong>$1.9 trillion</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, of course, we need to mention semiconductor company Nvidia, which had a market value
        of around <strong>$100 billion</strong> in 2019. Nvidia is now the most valuable company in
        the world with a net worth of <strong>$3.4 trillion</strong>, thanks to the AI revolution.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is the richest person on Earth?</h2>
      <p>
        According to the Forbes rich list, the richest person on Earth is currently Elon Musk. He's
        worth just under <strong>$400 billion</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's put that figure in words: <em>four hundred billion dollars</em>. Now again in numbers:{" "}
        <strong>$400,000,000,000</strong>. If you tried to withdraw that amount of money from the
        bank, not only would it cause some serious repetitive strain injuries for the cashiers, but
        the stack of $100 bills would reach <strong>255 miles high</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most commercial airplanes fly at 30,000 feet (5.7 miles), so imagine $100 bills reaching{" "}
        <strong>forty-four times higher</strong> than the clouds â€” and you'll be getting somewhere
        close to $400 billion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now imagine what sum of money could make these mega-billionaires look like paupers. Yes,
        today, we are talking in <strong>trillions</strong>.
      </p>
